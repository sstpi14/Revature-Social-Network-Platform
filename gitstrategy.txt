Git Strategy:

1. Create a diagram for how the application will work. 
2. (Main) Start with a basic template of the application.
3. (Main) Create folders for specific pathings.
4. (Branch off Main) Create branches off of main to begin work on backend and frontend.
5. (Branch off Branches) Use branches to work on individual portions of the full project.
6. (Branch off Branches) Speak with other members in group once portion is completed to see if merging is appropriate.
7. (Branch off Main) Merge similar branches together to ensure that they work with each other. (In a separate branch from main.)
8. (Branch off Main) Merge all branches together (separate from main) to ensure the project works.
9. (Main) Merge full branch to main.
10. Test.
11. Repeat 4-10 for each major iteration of application development to ensure the project is working as intended.
