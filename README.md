# Revature-Social-Network-Platform

A web application created with our company and co-workers in mind.

Brief Summary:

In this web application every Revature employee can connect to other employees, whether it be an associate, a trainer, or contracted employees. Each person has their own account, that comes with a unique username, Revature employee information. Within this network employees can access llocations and information to help them with many different possibilities. Also it is being created to ease the transition as a revature employee, wether it be as a traine/associate, contracted employee/contractor, or staff member.
